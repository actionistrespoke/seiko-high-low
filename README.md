Lazy source code and asset dump for the LOVE2D game "Seiko - High! Low!" because it's been sitting on my computer for no reason and I'd like to free up the space.

The names of the original artist(s) should be included alongside each file or the folder in which they're contained. Do whatever with the code, don't use the assets without credit or permission (obviously), and so on. Thanks, have fun.
